#### üßê About
The repository provides unambiguous probes (i.e., probes uniquely mapping to the target region) for Illumina 450K, EPIC/850K, and EPICv2.0/935K methylation arrays. These probes are evaluated using T2T-CHM13, the pangenome, and a combination of 95 assemblies (including T2T-CHM13 and 94 assemblies from the pangenome). Cross-population and population-specific unambiguous probes identified using the pangenome reference are also available. Importantly, we offer T2T-CHM13-based annotation information for each unambiguous probe, which can be leveraged to infer the potential biological functions of DNA methylation alterations in Epigenome-Wide Association Studies.

The Illumina Infinium BeadChip array is the most widely used tool for characterizing genome-wide DNAm in humans, designed to measure DNAm level by the specific hybridization of each probe to the target DNAm site. The Illumina Infinium BeadChip array has a number of advantages in that it can be used
to assess patterns of DNAm with single-nucleotide resolution, is easy to use, is cost-effective,
and has high specificity and sensitivity. In addition, the arrays outlined above consistently
showed high reproducibility across technical and biological replicates, and demonstrated strong
correlations both with each other and with WGBS data. Given these advantages, DNAm arrays are widely used for genome-wide DNAm profiling in human
populations.
