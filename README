The repository provides unambiguous probes (i.e., probes uniquely mapping to the target region) for Illumina 450K, EPIC/850K, and EPICv2.0/935K methylation arrays. These probes are evaluated using T2T-CHM13, the pangenome, and a combination of 95 assemblies (including T2T-CHM13 and 94 assemblies from the pangenome). Cross-population and population-specific unambiguous probes identified using the pangenome reference are also available. Importantly, we offer T2T-CHM13-based annotation information for each unambiguous probe, which can be leveraged to infer the potential biological functions of DNA methylation alterations in Epigenome-Wide Association Studies.
  
    430,719 unambiguous probes on the HM450K array
    777,491 unambiguous probes on the EPIC (v1.0) array
    859,216 unambiguous probes on the EPIC v2.0 array

These unambiguous probes are developed using the concepts and methods described in Dong et al. (2024).
